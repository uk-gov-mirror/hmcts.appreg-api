/**
 * API-facing Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a Result Code record.
 *
 * <p>This is the "read model" returned to clients when fetching a result code
 * (via GET endpoints). It deliberately decouples the REST API contract from
 * the JPA entity so that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Internal persistence details are hidden from consumers.</li>
 *   <li>The contract remains stable even if the database schema changes.</li>
 *   <li>Only relevant fields are exposed to frontend clients.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All fields are immutable, as this is declared as a Java {@code record}.
